# IT314 Course Project : Stock Market Analysis and Prediction (SMAP)

Setup
install the server dependencies
    
    npm install

install the client dependencies
  
    cd client
    npm install

set up the server using nodemon so server restarts automatically if changes are made

    npm run dev 
    
set up and launch the frontend (requires the server to be online)

    cd client
    npm start
  

You will need 2 extra files:
-   admin-key.json (contains the admin authentication for firebase)
-   smapgmail.js (contains the credentials for the project gmail account)

You can find where to place the files based on the .gitignore file.
